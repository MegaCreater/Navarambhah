# Object Detection using YOLO

This is a basic object detection project implemented in Python using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm.

## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate object detection capabilities using YOLO, a deep learning algorithm known for its real-time object detection capabilities. The model is implemented in Python and utilizes the power of deep learning to detect various objects within an image.

## Features

- Object detection using YOLO algorithm
- Basic model implementation
- Real-time object detection
- Python-based implementation
